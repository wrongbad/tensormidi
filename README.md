# tensormidi

Extremely fast midi parser, returning packed numpy arrays, for efficient batch processing especially in machine learning use cases.


C++ headers are installed with python packge, and can be found with `python -m tensormidi.includes`
You can use that command in makefiles to compile against the C++ backend directly.
